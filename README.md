# Breast Cancer Disease Detection
Breast cancer originates in your breast tissue. It occurs when breast cells mutate (change) and grow out of control, creating a mass of tissue (tumor). 
Like other cancers, breast cancer can invade and grow into the tissue surrounding your breast. It can also travel to other body parts and form new tumors. 
When this happens, it's called metastasis.

This project introduces an innovative Breast Cancer Detection System that integrates machine  learning, web development, and Robotic Process Automation (RPA). The main objective is to create a 
comprehensive system for the early and accurate identification of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) in  histology images, ultimately leading to timely diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.
The project employs three machine learning approaches: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),  transfer learning with EfficientNetV2S, and an autoencoder-based method. Data preprocessing involves a 
diverse dataset of 162 breast cancer slide images, emphasizing the importance of preparing data for  effective model training. Notably, the system features a user-friendly web interface developed using 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing seamless interactions for end-users. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is seamlessly integrated using Automation Anywhere, automating 
tasks such as opening Visual Studio Code, starting the Flask server, interacting with the web browser, and capturing and interpreting output. This RPA integration enhances the system's efficiency and 
usability.
